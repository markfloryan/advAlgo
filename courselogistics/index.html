<h2 id="syllabus"><a name="syllabus"></a>Syllabus</h2>
<p>The syllabus for the course can be found <a
href="./syllabus.pdf">here</a>. Most (but not all) of that information
is summarized here.</p>
<h2 id="lectures-and-attendance-policy"><a name="lectures"></a>Lectures
and Attendance Policy</h2>
<p><strong>Lectures</strong> will be held in-person in the classroom
listed on the University Registrar. Lectures will be recorded for the
convenience of those who cannot intend or prefer not to for any
reason.</p>
<p>The <strong>class schedule</strong> depends on the day of the week.
On Tuesdays we will generally have a traditional lecture in which
material is presented to you by the instructor. On Thursday, we will do
one of three things: Lecture, Take an in-person quiz (2 total), work
together on a homework assignment (6 total), or cancel class (if we get
ahead of schedule).</p>
<p><strong>Class attendance is mandatory</strong>. Every lecture, I will
have a computer program randomly select 20 names from the roster. If
your name is chosen and you are not present on class for any reason,
then your participation score will drop by 2 percentage points (you will
lose 2 of the 12 percent participation grade). I have a good reason for
instituting this policy, which will be justified to you in person during
the first class period.</p>
<p>Our classroom is a <strong>no technology zone</strong> (except for
the projector used for the slides) during traditional lectures (Mondays
and Wednesdays). The purpose of this policy is to ensure students are
present and paying attention to the lecture consistently. If you use
technology during lecture, then I will consider you absent and deduct
from your participation score. I will also justify this policy to you
verbally during the first class period. On <strong>Thursdays, you will
use your laptops to work on homework assignments collaboratively with
others (not every Thursday)</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="textbook"><a name="textbook"></a>Textbook</h2>
<p>We’ll post readings from the following two sources (one is a
textbook, the other a curated website of algorithms concepts). We urge
you to read them or get that info from another source.</p>
<p><em>Introduction to Algorithms</em> by Cormen, et. al., 3rd edition.
Referred to as “CLRS”. UVA Library has a digital version of CLRS
available <a
href="https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/u6757775">online for
free</a> * CP-Algorithms. A curated website of algorithm ideas for
competitive programming (https://cp-algorithms.com)</p>
<h2 id="topics"><a name="homeworks"></a>Topics</h2>
<p>The course covers the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fenwick Trees</strong>: An advanced array that allows for
fast range queries</li>
<li><strong>Segment Trees</strong>: An advanced tree that allows for
fast range queries and updates</li>
<li><strong>Linear Programming:</strong> A general advanced approach to
solving many optimization problems</li>
<li><strong>Computational Geometry:</strong> Some basic algorithms
involving space, shapes, intersections, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Van Emde Boas Trees:</strong> A neat optimization on search
trees that are very fast</li>
<li><strong>Approximation Algorithms:</strong> Approaches for when you
can’t find the optimal solution fast</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="homeworks"><a name="homeworks"></a>Homeworks</h2>
<p>There will be <strong>six programming challenges</strong> that we
will give for homework. Each assignment should be done individually, but
high-level discussion is allowed. Each assignment will consist of a
problem statement and sample input/output. Gradescope will be available
for submissions and assignments will be autograded. The general flow for
homework assignements is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thursday before due date:</strong> The assignment will be
released in lecture. We will discuss it briefly and everybody will work
on it during class. I will walk around and help everyone get intuition
on how to approach the problem and some of the tricks that needs to be
overcome. During this class period you may collaborate with your
neighbors and peers.</li>
<li><strong>Following Tuesday:</strong> The assignment is due on
gradescope by midnight.</li>
<li><strong>Sunday after that:</strong> Everybody gets an automatic
extension to the following Sunday evening. This is NOT intended to be
used unless you absolutely need it. NO extensions will be given beyond
this for ANY REASON.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="quizzes"><a name="lectures"></a>Quizzes</h2>
<p>There will be two quizzes given throughout the term. Please reference
the course schedule for details on the dates and content of each quiz.
Each quiz will be short and is meant to quickly test your basic
understanding of the concepts from class. These will be held in-person,
in-class, on specific <strong>Thursdays</strong> throughout the term.
The schedule can be referenced to see which Thursday class periods have
quizzes scheduled.</p>
<h2 id="final-project"><a name="final"></a>Final Project</h2>
<p>There is <strong>NO final exam</strong> for this class. Instead,
there is a <strong>final project</strong>. Each student will join a
group of other students (3-4 per group) and be given an
<strong>algorithm</strong> to study on their own. The group will need to
do the following for their algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learn it:</strong> Study and understand the algorithm you
were assigned / chosen.</li>
<li><strong>Apply it:</strong> Design a homework assignment that
requires some application of the algorithm you studied.</li>
<li><strong>Solve it:</strong> Write the solution to your homework
assignment, along with test cases that test the solution.</li>
<li><strong>Teach it:</strong> Create a slide-deck that teaches this
algorithm to the class and present it to everybody in lecture.</li>
</ul>
<p>More details on this project will be provided once it is
available.</p>
<h2 id="grading"><a name="lettergrades"></a>Grading</h2>
<p>This course will use a <strong>standard weighted-average grading
system</strong>. The grade breakdown is shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Homework (40 percent)</strong>: There will be six
programming challenges which account in total for 30 percent of the
final grade.</li>
<li><strong>Quizzes (30 percent)</strong>: There will be two in-class
quizzes which account for 30 percent of the final grade.</li>
<li><strong>Attendance (12 percent)</strong>: Attendance and
participation are required in this course. Every lecture, a random
subset of students will be chosen by a computer program for attendance.
If your name is chosen and you are not present, you will lose 2 of these
12 percentage points.</li>
<li><strong>Final Project (18 percent)</strong>: There will be a final
project in which groups of students study, implement, prepare, and
present one advanced algorithm of their choosing. Details will be
available on the course website.</li>
</ul>
